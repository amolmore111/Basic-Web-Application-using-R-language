# Basic-Web-Application-using-R-language

This project is a Shiny web application designed to visualize data using different plot types (Scatter Plot, Bar Plot, and Line Plot).
Users can upload a dataset in CSV format, select X and Y variables, and choose the plot type to generate visualizations.

# How to Use the App:

# 1. Install Required Packages:
Before running the application, make sure you have installed the shiny package in R. You can install it using install.packages("shiny").
# 2. Run the Application:
Open R or RStudio and load the shiny library using library(shiny).
Copy and paste the entire code provided into your R environment.
# 3. Upload a Dataset:
Use the "Upload Dataset" button in the sidebar panel to upload your dataset in CSV format.
# 4. Select X and Y Variables:
Once the dataset is uploaded, the application will automatically update the variable choices based on the columns in your dataset.
Choose the X variable and Y variable from the dropdown menus.
# 5. Select Plot Type:
Choose the plot type from the "Select Plot Type" dropdown menu. You can choose between "Scatter Plot", "Bar Plot", and "Line Plot".
# 6. Generate Visualization:
The app will generate the selected plot type using the chosen X and Y variables.
The plot will be displayed in the main panel of the application.

# ....Important Notes:
The uploaded dataset should be in CSV format and must have a header row containing column names.
Ensure that your dataset is in a clean and appropriate format for visualization.

# ....Additional Improvements:
The current implementation supports only three plot types. You can extend the functionality by adding more plot types (e.g., box plot, histogram, etc.).
You can improve the user interface by adding labels, descriptions, and styling to enhance the overall user experience.
Consider adding error handling for scenarios where the uploaded dataset is not in the expected format or if the chosen variables do not match the plot type.
